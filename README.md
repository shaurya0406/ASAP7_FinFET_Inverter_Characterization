  <summary>2. BSIM4 CMG FinFET Model</summary>

  **Description:**
  The [**BSIM4 Compact Multi-Gate (CMG) Model**](https://www.bsim.berkeley.edu/models/bsimcmg/) is a widely accepted SPICE model used for FinFET transistors. It offers a framework for simulating devices with multi-gate structures, including double-gate and triple-gate FinFETs, which are the foundation of modern nanometer-scale transistor technology.

  **Why Chosen:**
  The BSIM4 CMG model was chosen due to its compatibility with FinFET technology, particularly the 7nm FinFETs used in this project. It provides a highly accurate representation of the electrical behavior of FinFET devices, including short-channel effects, mobility degradation, and quantum effects. This model is essential for achieving precise simulation results in advanced CMOS designs like the inverter being characterized.

  **Version:** [Standard Release BSIM-CMG 111.2.1 (06/06/2022)](https://www.bsim.berkeley.edu/BSIMCMG/BSIM-CMG_111.2.1_06062022.tar.gz)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. OpenVAF</summary>

  **Description:**
  [**OpenVAF (Open Verilog Analog Framework)**](https://openvaf.semimod.de) is a tool used to integrate analog and mixed-signal simulations into a Verilog environment. It allows for both analog and digital simulations to coexist, enabling the simulation of circuits that involve both types of signals, such as inverters and mixed-signal systems.

  **Why Chosen:**
  OpenVAF is used to bridge the gap between analog and digital simulations in this project. Given that the inverter design involves both analog characteristics (e.g., voltage transfer curves) and digital characteristics (e.g., logic levels), OpenVAF facilitates a seamless simulation workflow. It also allows for mixed-mode verification, ensuring the design is fully validated in both analog and digital domains.

  **Usage** OpenVAF is used to generate the BSIM_OSDI Image compatible with NGSpice Simulation from the downloaded BSIM CMG Models

  The `bsimosdi.osdi` file plays a crucial role when working with **OpenVAF** and **BSIM4 CMG** models in **NGSpice simulations**. 

#### What is `bsimosdi.osdi`?

`bsimosdi.osdi` is a data file generated by **OpenVAF** that serves as an **Optimized Simulator Sata Interface** (OSDI) for BSIM models, specifically **BSIM4 CMG FinFET models**. This file encapsulates the device model information in a format that is highly efficient for NGSpice simulations, reducing the computational load required to handle complex FinFET device physics.

---

#### Workflow for Generating and Using `bsimosdi.osdi`:

1. **Download the BSIM CMG Model Files:**
   - These are provided by various sources (like Berkeley) for FinFET devices.

2. **Generate the `bsimosdi.osdi` File Using OpenVAF:**
   - OpenVAF processes the **BSIM4 CMG** model files and converts them into the `bsimosdi.osdi` format, which is optimized for NGSpice.
   - During this process, the model parameters are encoded into a format that NGSpice can directly interpret.

3. **Include the `bsimosdi.osdi` in NGSpice Simulations:**
   - In your NGSpice simulation script (SPICE netlist), the `bsimosdi.osdi` file is referenced to load the pre-compiled BSIM model data.
   - Symbol files are created using ASAP7 PDK Data for parameter values of BSIM CMG Model.
   - These symbol files contain the reference for the generated `bsimosdi.osdi`
ary file.
   - Example: In the [7nm NFET Symbol file](Xschem_ASAP7/asap_7nm_nfet.sym)
   ```SPICE
    .control
    pre_osdi <path_to_generated_bsimosdi.osdi>
    .endc
   ```
   - NGSpice uses this osdi file to simulate the behavior of the FinFET devices in your circuit without needing to recalculate model parameters from scratch.

It supports hierarchical design, and its integration with **NGSpice** makes it a powerful tool for simulation and analysis. It’s particularly useful for creating circuit schematics and generating the necessary SPICE netlists for simulation.

  **Why Chosen:**
  Xschem was chosen due to its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with NGSpice. For this project, where FinFET-based circuits like NFETs and inverters are being simulated, Xschem simplifies the design process and provides a quick way to visualize circuit schematics. Its support for hierarchical designs also helps in managing complex designs efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>5. NGSpice</summary>

  **Description:**
  **NGSpice** is an open-source mixed-level/mixed-signal electronic circuit simulator. It’s used for simulating circuits at the transistor level, offering SPICE-like capabilities. NGSpice is widely used in academic and professional settings to perform various types of simulations, including DC, AC, transient, and noise analysis.

  **Why Chosen:**
  NGSpice was selected because of its powerful simulation capabilities, particularly for the DC and AC characterization of circuits in this project. It is essential for generating the voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) of the inverter design, and its compatibility with both Xschem and the BSIM4 CMG FinFET model makes it the ideal simulation tool for this FinFET-based project.

## Types of Simulations
<details>
  <summary><strong> Types of Simulations </strong></summary>

1. **DC Simulation:** This is time-independent and is used to analyze circuits without considering time-varying elements like capacitors or inductors. Capacitors are treated as open circuits, and inductors as short circuits. This is useful for determining how circuits respond to fixed voltage or current sources.
2. **Transient Simulation:** Time-dependent simulation, which models the behavior of circuits over time. It's more complex than DC simulations and requires initial conditions (often obtained from a preceding DC simulation) for capacitors and inductors.
3. **AC Simulation:** Involves frequency-dependent analysis. It’s typically used for analog circuits like amplifiers, where you need to know the frequency range in which the amplifier works effectively.

**Inverter Testbench:**
   ![Inverter Testbench](images/Inverter_Testbench.png)

This Xschem schematic defines a setup for simulating an inverter circuit using FinFETs with varying transistor fin sizes. It includes sources for power and input, ground connections, and measurements for important metrics like delay, gain, noise margins, power consumption, and switching frequency. Here's a breakdown:

<details>
    <summary><strong> Testbench Components </strong></summary>

##### Testbench Components

1. **Inverter Design**: The inverter (`inverter.sym`) is placed in the circuit with connections to VDD, VIN, and VOUT.
2. **Voltage Sources**:
   - VDD is set to 0.7V.
   - VIN is a pulse signal defined as `"PULSE(0 0.7 0p 10p 10p 20p 60p 2)"`, representing a periodic input for the inverter.
3. **Ground Connections**: Three GND components connect to different parts of the circuit.
4. **Pins**: The schematic has labeled pins (e.g., VDD, VIN, VOUT) for signal clarity.
5. **Script Component** (`code_shown.sym`): This section defines a control script in `.control` blocks that automates simulations, sweeping through different fin sizes for the nFET and pFET transistors (from 2 to 14 fins).

    - The simulation is carried out using **NGSpice** to observe the inverter's voltage transfer characteristics (VTC). The **Vin** is swept from 0 to VDD, and **Vout** is measured at different points to capture the inverter's response.
    - It performs a **DC analysis** to find the voltage at which VIN equals VOUT (Vm), as well as measures metrics like gain, output resistance, and noise margins (NMH and NML).
    - It also conducts **transient analysis** to measure timing metrics like rise and fall times, propagation delay, and switching frequency.
    - Power consumption is calculated based on current through the VDD source.


The results are saved to a CSV file (`results.csv`) with fields for WpFET, WnFET, Vm, Id, gain, NMH, NML, Gm, propagation delay (tpd), rise time (tRise), fall time (tFall), switching frequency (Fsw), power, and output resistance (Rout).
