# ASAP7_FinFET_Inverter_Characterization
This repository provides a comprehensive characterization of a 7nm FinFET-based inverter designed using the ASAP7 PDK. The project includes schematic capture with Xschem, layout design using Magic, and simulation using NGSpice. The key deliverables are the DC, AC, and Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC) analysis, offering valuable insights into the performance of FinFET-based inverters at advanced technology nodes. This work is intended to serve as a resource for researchers, students, and engineers in the field of VLSI design and nanoelectronics. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
