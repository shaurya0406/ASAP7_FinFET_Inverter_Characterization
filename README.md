## Types of Simulations
<details>
  <summary><strong> Types of Simulations </strong></summary>

1. **DC Simulation:** This is time-independent and is used to analyze circuits without considering time-varying elements like capacitors or inductors. Capacitors are treated as open circuits, and inductors as short circuits. This is useful for determining how circuits respond to fixed voltage or current sources.
2. **Transient Simulation:** Time-dependent simulation, which models the behavior of circuits over time. It's more complex than DC simulations and requires initial conditions (often obtained from a preceding DC simulation) for capacitors and inductors.
3. **AC Simulation:** Involves frequency-dependent analysis. Itâ€™s typically used for analog circuits like amplifiers, where you need to know the frequency range in which the amplifier works effectively.

### Inverter Pre Layout Sim & Characterisation
<details>
  <summary><strong> 1. Schematic Design </strong></summary>

#### 1. Schematic Design
   - The pre-layout schematic design of the inverter is created using **Xschem**. The design consists of a basic CMOS inverter with a PFET and NFET transistor, where the PFET is connected to VDD and the NFET to GND.
   - The input signal, **Vin**, is applied to the gate terminals of both transistors, while the output signal, **Vout**, is observed at the shared drain of the PFET and NFET.

This Xschem schematic defines a setup for simulating an inverter circuit using FinFETs with varying transistor fin sizes. It includes sources for power and input, ground connections, and measurements for important metrics like delay, gain, noise margins, power consumption, and switching frequency. Here's a breakdown:

<details>
    <summary><strong> Testbench Components </strong></summary>

##### Testbench Components

1. **Inverter Design**: The inverter (`inverter.sym`) is placed in the circuit with connections to VDD, VIN, and VOUT.
2. **Voltage Sources**:
   - VDD is set to 0.7V.
   - VIN is a pulse signal defined as `"PULSE(0 0.7 0p 10p 10p 20p 60p 2)"`, representing a periodic input for the inverter.
3. **Ground Connections**: Three GND components connect to different parts of the circuit.
4. **Pins**: The schematic has labeled pins (e.g., VDD, VIN, VOUT) for signal clarity.
5. **Script Component** (`code_shown.sym`): This section defines a control script in `.control` blocks that automates simulations, sweeping through different fin sizes for the nFET and pFET transistors (from 2 to 14 fins).

    - The simulation is carried out using **NGSpice** to observe the inverter's voltage transfer characteristics (VTC). The **Vin** is swept from 0 to VDD, and **Vout** is measured at different points to capture the inverter's response.
    - It performs a **DC analysis** to find the voltage at which VIN equals VOUT (Vm), as well as measures metrics like gain, output resistance, and noise margins (NMH and NML).
    - It also conducts **transient analysis** to measure timing metrics like rise and fall times, propagation delay, and switching frequency.
    - Power consumption is calculated based on current through the VDD source.


The results are saved to a CSV file (`results.csv`) with fields for WpFET, WnFET, Vm, Id, gain, NMH, NML, Gm, propagation delay (tpd), rise time (tRise), fall time (tFall), switching frequency (Fsw), power, and output resistance (Rout).
